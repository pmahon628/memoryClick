# memoryClick
This game is intended to be a memory guessing game built using REACT and then bootstrap for styling.  I am quite proud of this project as I believe I did pretty well to get the functionality that it needed as per the assignment requirements for the bootcamp course.

As with all my repo's this is an ever evolving repo as I get better at REACT and more features.

TO RUN:

If you are interested in seeing how this game works, please follow these instructions:

1.  Clone repo onto desktop
2. Run npm -install
3.  Once game opens:
  a: follow instructions - click pictures of the bands and do not guess the same one twice.
 Enjoy!
