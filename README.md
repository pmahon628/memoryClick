# memoryClick
This game is intended to be a memory guessing game built using REACT and then bootstrap for styling.  I am quite proud of this project as I believe I did pretty well to get the functionality that it needed as per the assignment requirements for the bootcamp course.

As with all my repo's this is an ever evolving repo as I get better at REACT and more features.
